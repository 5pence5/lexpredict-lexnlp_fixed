    GOOD: ----------------------------------------------------------<br/>--- In this section there are examples of definitions that I consider<br/>--- proper ones.<br/><br/>#SAMPLE 01<br/><br/>The Bonds are limited obligations of the Authority, secured under the provisions of the Indenture and Loan Agreement, as described herein,<br/>and will be payable from Loan Repayments made by Stanford Health Care <a href="#" title="[1] (the &quot;Corporation&quot;)">REFR#1 (the “Corporation”)</a> under the Loan Agreement and from certain funds<br/>held under the Indenture.<br/><br/>#SAMPLE 02<br/><br/>The 2017 Series A Bonds <a href="#" title="[2] (the &quot;Bonds&quot;)">REFR#2 (the “Bonds”)</a> are being issued as fully registered bonds and initially will be registered in the name of Cede &amp; Co.,<br/>as nominee for The Depository Trust Company, New York, New York <a href="#" title="[3] (&quot;DTC&quot;)">REFR#3 (“DTC”)</a>.<br/><br/>#SAMPLE 03<br/><br/><a href="#" title="[4] Beneficial Owner ">REFR#4 Beneficial Owner </a>means any Person which has or shares the power, directly or indirectly, to make<br/>investment decisions concerning ownership of any of the Bonds (including any Person holding Bonds through<br/>nominees, depositories or other intermediaries).<br/><br/>#SAMPLE 04<br/><br/>--- Please note, that the sentence below contains 2 possible definitions: {Obligation and Obligations}.<br/>--- Before my update the parser would skip them both because the whole &quot;definition term&quot; {the text in<br/>--- braces: /// each an &#x27;Obligation&#x27; and <a href="#" title="[5] collectively, the &#x27;Obligations&#x27;">REFR#5 collectively, the &#x27;Obligations&#x27;</a> ///} contains 7 words -<br/>---  - <a href="#" title="[6] this &quot;term&quot;">REFR#6 this &quot;term&quot;</a> was considered as too long for a definition.<br/><br/>--- I changed the logic: now the parser allows this term be so long because the term contains 2 definitions:<br/>--- {&#x27;Obligation&#x27; and &#x27;Obligations&#x27;}. Is it better than was before?<br/><br/>--- Unfortunately, the parser captured &quot;definitions&quot; with some extra words. Right now I&#x27;m thinking on the way<br/>--- to make these 2 annotations being more strict.<br/><br/>Obligation No. 39, the outstanding Obligations relating to other indebtedness and obligations of the<br/>Corporation (as described below) and any other Obligations issued in the future under the Master Indenture, including<br/>the Obligation to be issued to evidence the Corporation’s obligations with respect to the payment of principal of and<br/>interest on the Taxable Bonds (each an “Obligation” and <a href="#" title="[7] collectively, the &quot;Obligations&quot;">REFR#7 collectively, the “Obligations”</a>), will be secured by security<br/>interests in (i) the Gross Revenues of each Member of the Obligated Group and (ii) the moneys on deposit from time<br/>to time in the Gross Revenue Fund established under the Master Indenture.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>BAD: -----------------------------------------------------------<br/>-- Here WERE a number of false-positives that I&#x27;ve fixed.<br/>-- E.g., the first word within the phrase followed by<br/>-- braces<br/><br/>#MISS 01<br/><br/>CALIFORNIA HEALTH FACILITIES FINANCING AUTHORITY<br/><br/>Refunding Revenue Bonds<br/>(STANFORD HEALTH CARE)<br/><br/>2017 Series A<br/><br/>#MISS 02<br/><br/>--- Here the parser used to find the word Corporation<br/>--- because it: was the first word in the sentence<br/>---   was followed by braces<br/>--- Fixed<br/><br/>Obligation No. 39, the outstanding Obligations relating to other indebtedness and obligations of the<br/>Corporation (as described below) and any other Obligations issued in the future under the Master Indenture.<br/><br/>#MISS 03<br/><br/>Noncontrolling capital (distribution) contribution, net (62) (1,000) 301<br/><br/>Increase (decrease) in unrestricted net assets 329,679 (21,202) 424,003<br/>Changes in temporarily restricted net assets:<br/><br/>#MISS 04<br/><br/> Operations (15,663) (9,372) (9,904)<br/> Purchase of property and equipment (2,288) (973) (1,320)<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>AVERAGE: -----------------------------------------------------------<br/>--- ..Bonds shall be deemed.. - I don&#x27;t think that it IS a definition,<br/>--- but I don&#x27;t know how to tell the parser that this case is not suitable.<br/><br/>#HITMISS 01<br/><br/>With respect to any notice of optional redemption of the Bonds, unless, upon the giving of such notice, such<br/><a href="#" title="[8] Bonds ">REFR#8 Bonds </a>shall be deemed to have been paid pursuant to the provisions of the Indenture, such notice shall state that such<br/>redemption shall be conditional upon the receipt by the Trustee on or prior to the date fixed for such redemption of<br/>amounts sufficient to pay the principal of and interest on, such Bonds to be redeemed, and that if such amounts shall<br/>not have been so received said notice shall be of no force and effect and the Authority shall not be required to redeem<br/>such Bonds and such failure to redeem such Bonds shall not constitute an Event of Default.<br/></p> <ol><li>(the “Corporation”): (the &quot;Corporation&quot;)</li><li>(the “Bonds”): (the &quot;Bonds&quot;)</li><li>(“DTC”): (&quot;DTC&quot;)</li><li>Beneficial Owner : Beneficial Owner </li><li>collectively, the &#x27;Obligations&#x27;: collectively, the &#x27;Obligations&#x27;</li><li>this &quot;term&quot;: this &quot;term&quot;</li><li>collectively, the “Obligations”: collectively, the &quot;Obligations&quot;</li><li>Bonds : Bonds </li>
